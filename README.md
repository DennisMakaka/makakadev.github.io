# The Maze Landing Page

Welcome to the landing page for **The Maze**, a 3D navigable maze project developed using raycasting techniques. This project showcases my skills in low-level game development and interactive environments.

## Overview

The Maze is an interactive 3D maze rendered in real-time using a custom-built raycasting engine. Users can navigate the maze, experiencing smooth camera movements and realistic interactions with the environment.

## Features

- **Raycasting Rendering Engine**: Renders a 3D environment in real-time from a 2D map.
- **Collision Detection**: Ensures realistic interaction, preventing users from clipping through walls.
- **Smooth Camera Movement**: Provides an intuitive navigation experience.
